# Special Character

A **special character** is a [character](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/charact.htm) that is not an [alphabetic](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/alphabetic.htm) or [numeric](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/numeric.htm) character. Punctuation marks and other symbols are examples of special characters. Unlike alphanumeric characters, special characters may have multiple uses. For example, when creating a web page with [HTML](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/html.htm), the quote (") symbol is used to store [attribute](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/attribut.htm) values. Because the quote is used in HTML, to use it in a web page, the [extended special HTML character code](https://www.computerhope.com/spechtm.htm) "&quot;" needs to be used. Also, like HTML, special characters may need to be [escaped](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/escasequ.htm) when used in the [command line](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm) and [programming languages](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/programming-language.htm) to prevent problems.
